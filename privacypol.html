                <h4>COOKIES</h4>
                <p><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong><br> As is common practice with almost all professional websites,
                    this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your
                    experience.</p>

                <p>This page describes what information they gather, how we use it, and why we sometimes need to store
                    these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored however this
                    may downgrade or ‘break’ certain elements of the site’s functionality.</p>

                <h4>HOW WE USE COOKIES</h4>
                <p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no
                    industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and
                    features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure
                    whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.</p>

                <h4>DISABLING COOKIES</h4>
                <p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser
                    help to know how to do it).</p>

                <p>Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that
                    you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and
                    features of this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.</p>

                <h4>THE COOKIES WE SET</h4>
                <p>If you create an account with us then we will use cookies for the management of the signup process
                    and general administration. These cookies will usually be deleted when you log out; however, in some
                    cases, they may remain afterward to remember your site preferences when logged out.</p>

                <p>We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this fact.</p>

                <p>This prevents you from having to log in every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are
                    typically removed or cleared when you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features
                    and areas when logged in.</p>

                <p>This site offers newsletter or email subscription services and cookies may be used to remember if you
                    are already registered and whether to show certain notifications, which might only be valid to
                    subscribe/unsubscribed users.</p>

                <p>This site offers e-commerce or payment facilities and some cookies are essential to ensure that your
                    order is remembered between pages so that we can process it properly.</p>

                <p>From time to time we offer user surveys and questionnaires to provide you with interesting insights,
                    helpful tools, or to understand our user base more accurately.</p>

                <p>These surveys may use cookies to remember who has already taken part in a survey or to provide you
                    with accurate results after you change pages.</p>

                <p>When you submit data through a form such as those found on contact pages or comment forms, cookies
                    may be set to remember your user details for future correspondence.</p>

                <h4>THIRD-PARTY COOKIES</h4>
                <p>In some special cases, we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties.</p>

                <p>This site uses Google Analytics, which is one of the most widespread and trusted analytics solutions
                    on the web to help us to understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve your
                    experience. These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that
                    you visit so we can continue to produce engaging content.</p>

                <h4>DOUBLECLICK COOKIE</h4>
                <p>Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our Service. Google’s use of the
                    DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our user base during their visit to
                    our site or other websites on the Internet.<br>
                    You may opt-out of the use of the DoubleClick Cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting the
                    Google Ads Settings web page.</p>

                <h4>BEHAVIORAL REMARKETING</h4>
                <p>BM XFinate Technologies LLC uses remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites to you
                    after you visited our Service. We and our third-party vendors, use cookies to inform, optimize and
                    serve ads based on your past visits to our website.</p>

                <h4>MORE INFORMATION</h4>
                <p>Hopefully, that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something
                    that you aren’t sure about, it’s usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interfere
                    with one of the features you use on our site. However, if you are still looking for more information
                    then you can contact us through one of our preferred contact methods.</p>

                <h4>DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE</h4>
                <p>We do not support Do Not Track (“DNT”). Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser
                    to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by
                    visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>

                <h4>SERVICE PROVIDERS</h4>
                <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our service, provide the service on
                    our behalf, perform service-related services and/or assist us in analyzing how our service is used.

                <p>These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform specific tasks on our
                    behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use your information for any other purpose.</p>

                <h4>COMMUNICATIONS</h4>
                <p>We may use your personal information to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional
                    materials, and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving any,
                    or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided
                    in any email we send or by contacting us.</p>

                <h4>COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS</h4>
                <p>We will disclose your personal information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we
                    believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law
                    enforcement or to protect the security or integrity of our service.</p>

                <h4>BUSINESS TRANSACTION</h4>
                <p>If BM XFinate Technologies LLC is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your personal

                <h4>SECURITY</h4>
                <p>The security of your personal information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain
                    reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of
                    the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use,
                    modification, or disclosure.</p>

                <p>However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
                    storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the personal
                    information we have collected from you.</p>

                <h4>CREDIT CARD SECURITY</h4>
                <p>Your payment and personal information are always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the
                    industry standard and among the best software available today for securing commercial transactions.
                    It encrypts all of your personal information, including your credit card number, name, and address
                    so that it cannot be read over the internet.</p>

                <p>We do not sell, rent or trade the personal information of the customer to any 3rd parties.</p>

                <h4>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h4>

                    computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where
                    the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.</p>

                <p>If you are located outside of the United States and include personal information to the United
                    States. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information
                    represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

                <h4>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h4>
                <p>Our service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a
                    third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to review
